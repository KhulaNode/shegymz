# Email Notifications - Quick Start

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your SheGymz application now has full email notification support using Plunk!

### Automated Emails

1. **When a user submits the subscription form:**
   - ✉️ Welcome email sent to the user
   - 📧 Admin notification about new subscription

2. **When payment is completed (Yoco webhook):**
   - ✅ Payment confirmation email to the user
   - 💰 Payment received notification to admin

### Features

- Beautiful HTML email templates
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Error handling (emails won't break your app if they fail)
- Asynchronous sending (doesn't slow down your API)
- Easy to customize and extend

## 🚀 Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### 1. Get Plunk API Key

### 2. Add to Environment Variables

```

### 3. Verify Domain in Plunk
- Go to Plunk Dashboard → Settings → Domains
